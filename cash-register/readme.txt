This is a modified task from freeCodeCamp.

When the button "Calculate" is clicked, a function is executed. This function returns STATUS and CHANGE (in case if status is OPEN).

Return status: "INSUFFICIENT FUNDS" if cash-in-drawer is less than the change due, or if you cannot return the exact change.

Return status: "CLOSED" if the change due is equal to 0.

Otherwise, return status: "OPEN" and change array, with the change due in coins and bills, sorted in highest to lowest order.
