This is a modified task from freeCodeCamp.

When a text is inputed and button "Check text" is clicked, the function displays "This is a palindrome!" if the given string is a palindrome. Otherwise, it displays "Sorry, this is not a palindrome".

A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.

Note:

Function palindrome() removes all non-alphanumeric characters (punctuation, spaces and symbols) and turns everything into the same case (lower case) in order to check for palindromes.

There is also "Clear text" button, which clears the text inside the textarea and the displayed answer (if any) once it's clicked.
